[Content script](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts) is a nice way to create a chrome plugin that essentially run our Javascript on a page.

Here is a little skeletton to build on.

# How to use

- git clone the project locally 

- amend everything that you need to:  
_manifest.json has a reference to all the files that will be loaded._

Then in Chrome, load your extension and voilà!
